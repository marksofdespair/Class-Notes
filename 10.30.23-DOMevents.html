<!--JS was originally created in 1995 to run in a browser-->
<!--The browser dev tools contain a consol for viewing logged info-->

<!--External script is put in a seperate js file often called script.js-->
<!--Internal is JS placed directly between the <script> tags, no src attribute-->
<!--Must put in the end of <body> tags that require constant updating-->
<!--Each element in an HTML file can be represented by a JS object
    Each obj contains all the info available about the element in represents:
    -Content
    -Styling
    -More
-->

<!--JS can read from and update the HTML in the browser.-->
<!--representing HTML elements with JS objects-->

<!--
<p id="'intro" style="'font-size: 14px">
    Testing 1 2 3</p>

    id: 'intro',
    style: {
        fontSize: '14px';
    },
    innerHTML: 'Testing 1 2 3...'
}
idk what the original example said, it doesnt seem to like this bracket
