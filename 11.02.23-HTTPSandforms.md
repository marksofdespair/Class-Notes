protocol  |   domainname   |   path   query    parameters                fragment
        subdomain         port

-Port will not always show, but that's what that number after the domain name is.
-Path will take you to some kind of resource located within that webapp
-# is an anchor tab with the fragment - a source within the page. Uh, apparently needed to be in assignment 4 :)   
    oops!

inspect will take you to dev tools.

inputs HAVE TO HAVE NAME ATTRIBUTES or the dom won't work.
-placeholder=placeholder text is not interactable/editedable by the user and disappears as soon as they start
 typing in the textbox. Can provide further context about what's supposed to go in the box.

Are you cool? <label><input type="radio" name="isCool" value="yes">Yes </label><input type="radio" name="isCool" value="no">no

    I really wasn't paying attention during this lecture idk what's wrong lmao :skull:

Wasn't there two videos I was supposed to watch?

I tried the 'exercise' of searching different things and then looking at the url to see if its a GET request.
Even when copy and pasted I wasn't seeing the request type? I might be stupid.

AAAA BUTTONS NEED TO BE SUBMIT TYPE?

<input type="submit" value="Gerard Sure Typed Something"><button style="height:200%;">DO IT</button>
something about having multiple buttons in one form uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

GET retrieves data
POST new data???
(VERIFY LATER IDK IF I HEARD THAT)

Dude I literally do not know what is going on, it's never been this hard to pay attention before lmao
