Different styles
Different tags
Different weight can be applied to those fonts and texts

Static pages are what we've made so far
Dynamic webpages are what events shine the best by capturing and handling them as people interact with.
Mouse events such as
-click
-dblclick
-mouseover
-mousedown
-mouseup
-mousemove
-drag
-drop

Keyboard events, etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) User triggers event
2) Script executes the function specified and updates the HTML with the content
3) etc

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Events can be handled directly in the tag of the element if the script is also internal
Instead of using an event attribute in a tag to call an internal event handler in the HTML file, you can list for the event from your script.

The dom method .addEventListener() takes 2 arguments:

-A string with specific event type (example: 'click')
-A function, either a reference to a named function or an anon function, which contains the code that should be     
    executed when the event is detected.

1) Add a load event listener to the window object to execute all your coe when the broswer is ready
2) sometimes there will be seperate function to hold all the objects and listeners, which can be called from the load listener
3) Arrange your code in a logical order and keep it organized
4) Pay attention to scope woth your objects and functions

I typed all that without looking oh no :D
-In this example she added a .toLocale with the date, which we do at the top of almost every date.

const date = document.getElementByID:"date";

v further down v

I COULD NOT SEE THE GODDAMN CODE I AM BLIND ASF

    (Wait can I add the time? Is there a toLocale version for the time? HM)
